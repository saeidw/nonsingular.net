My name is Saeid Al-Wazzan. I like to write programs, listen to music, play
video games, and enjoy beautiful things with the ones I love.

This is my personal website where I hope to write down my thoughts and share
insights from work and life. You might find some interesting things here, and
if you do, I would like to hear about them.

You can get in touch with me in one of the following ways:
