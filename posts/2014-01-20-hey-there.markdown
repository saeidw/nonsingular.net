I finally got around to actually putting something up here!
The site is stitched together out of Haskell, HTML and Markdown.
I tried to keep everything clean and semantic, you will notice that most
pages do not have file extensions. Instead, Apache does some smart content
negotiation to figure out which files to serve you.

I am pretty bad at design, so for now I will just stick with the CSS style
I put together from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com). I used a fluid
layout in the hopes that the content will still be readable on smaller
screen sizes. Let me know if you have problems getting to any content
on the site.
